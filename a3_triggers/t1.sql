--T1) check maintenance schedule: Trigger to check aircraft maintenance schedule before assigning Aircraft to a Flight: 
    --This trigger will ensure that aircraft scheduled for maintenance are not assigned to flights during the maintenance period
    --Before inserting or updating a flight record with an aircraft assignment, check if the aircraft is undergoing maintenance

-- When assigning an aircraft to a NEW flight, make sure the start_datetime does not coincide with the start_datime in maintenance event

--Step 1: create the function that checks for overlapping
